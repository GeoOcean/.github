## About Us
The **Geomatics and Ocean Engineering Group (GeoOcean)** at the *University of Cantabria* is an active research group with more than 15 years of accumulated expertise.  
We work at the intersection of **coastal engineering, ocean data science, numerical modeling, and climate**, developing open-source tools and scientific methods for coastal risk analysis.

---

## Research Focus
Our recent research lines include:

- 📊 **Statistical & numerical modeling** of wave climate, coastal hazards, and climate-change scenarios.  
- 🌊 **Coastal flooding risk assessment**, including variability and extremes.  
- 🛰️ **UAV-based coastal monitoring** for geomorphology and hazard detection.  
- 🌀 **Forecast systems** for swells, tropical cyclones, and compound flooding using machine learning and metamodels.  
- 🧩 **Open-source frameworks** to enable reproducible coastal and climate risk analysis.

</p>

**BlueMath** is our flagship open-source platform for **statistical analysis, probabilistic modeling, metamodeling, and coastal-hazard simulation**.  
It provides a unified environment for:

- 📈 Exploratory coastal & ocean data analysis  
- 📉 Probabilistic modeling (extremes, stochastic processes, uncertainty)  
- ⚙️ Numerical metamodels for waves, surge, flooding  
- 🌐 High-resolution climate-change risk assessment  
- 🤝 Reproducible research and collaborative workflows

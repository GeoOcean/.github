![GeoOcean Group](geoocean.png)

The Geomatics and Ocean Engineering Group (GeoOcean) from the Department of Sciences and Technologies of Water and Environment of University of Cantabria is a young scientific group supported by more than 15 years of scientific and engineering works by their senior members.

## Trajectory
During the last few years, our main research lines have been focused on:

- 📊 Development of statistical and numerical models to analyze wave climate, extremes, climate change, and sea level variations.
- 🌊 Development of tools for addressing problems of coastal flooding risk, including climate variability.
- 🛰️ UAV-based coastal monitoring.
- 🌀 Forecast systems of coastal flooding (swells and tropical cyclones) based on data mining and metamodels.
